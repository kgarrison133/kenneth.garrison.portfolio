      An Aspiring Software Engineer<br />

      I'm a Computing Technology and Software Development recent graduate from Valencia College. </br>
      I'm an Air Force Veteran who spent seven years in the military with service in Afghanistan. </br>
      While being familiar with the full software development life cycle, I also develop projects using mainly 
      Java, HTML, and CSS. During my free time, I like to explore new places, learn new technologies, and attend hackathons.

    <h2>Skills</h2>

      <!-- begin div for boxes -->
      <div class="responsive-flex">

    <div class="skill"><h6>Back End</h6>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><h5>Java</h5> <i class="fa-brands fa-java"></i></div>
    <p>I've taken Java courses, including COP
        2800C, COP 2805C, CEN 3024C, and CEN 4025C as Java is the main programming
        language for my B.A.S program. During my degree, I have made Java programs for assignments such as a text analyzer that scrapes information from a website, 
        then organizes text from the website in alphabetical order, then gives a word count for each word. Another assignment was to create a program that goes through the Fibonacci sequence. One of the longest assignments
        that I have had to work on was to create a to-do list. While it was simple at first, we used an Agile development method, which kept adding requirements every week to the assignment. In the end, 
        the assignment had to add items, delete items, look up items, use Jprofiler, use Jmeter, add injection vulnerability, Fix the injection vulnerability, use Hibernate, and use Maven. 
    </p></div>

    <div class="skill"><h6>Front End</h6>
         <div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><h5>HTML & CSS</h5> <div><i class="fa-brands fa-html5"> </i> <i class="fa-brands fa-css3-alt"></i></div></div>
    <p>
      I've developed multiple responsive websites using HTML and CSS to include a website for Valencia College to highlight the B.A.S. program
      for Software Development. I have also used Bootstrap extensively and have taken a course for front end web development during my spare time through Udemy
      which teaches HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and more. 
    </p></div>

    <div class="skill"><h6>Testing</h6>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><h5>Software Integration, Configuration, and Testing</h5> <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> </div>
    <p>Experience with Software integration, configuration, and testing using tools such as Apache Tomcat, Apache Jmeter, 
        Jenkins, Docker, and Maven. I also have experience with the development of testing plans for software through my course of study at college.
    </p></div>

    <div class="skill"><h6>Database</h6>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><h5>SQL</h5> <i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-database"></i> </div> 
    <p>Through my course of study, I have learned to write SQL queries and develop Entity Relationship Diagrams. 
            I have developed a project called City Jail for my course CEN 4333C, which develops a structured relationship between the jail, its residents, 
            the officers involved, court dates, and more. 
    </p></div>

    <div class="skill"><h6>Version Control</h6>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><h5>Git and Github</h5> <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> </div> 
    <p>
      My course of study has trained me in version control methods. I have used Github for multiple assignments and even used Github for hackthons that 
      I have attended. Furthermore, I have used Github while collaborating with multiple people at once. The website that I helped develop for Valencia College
      had 14 students working on it and we had to collaborate with each other using version control. 
    </p></div>
    
    <div class="skill"><h6>Soft Skills</h6>
       <div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><h5>Leadership Skills</h5> <i class="fa-solid fa-jet-fighter-up"></i> </div> 
    <p>Graduated from Airman Leadership School from the United States Air Force. While in the Air Force, I served as the Airman's Leadership Council
      President for two years and helped lead projects that assisted with improving the quality of life for junior enlisted Airmen on base and helped
      develop leadership abilities for members of the council who served under my leadership. I was also promoted to Staff Sergeant and was responsible for the 
      training and development of multiple Airmen under my supervision. 
    </p></div>

    <div class="skill"><h6>Soft Skills</h6>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-between"><h5>Guest Service</h5> <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake"></i> </div>
    <p>
      Through working in the Communications Squadron in the Air Force for over a year, I have first hand guest service experience in the realm of Information Technology.
      I have worked at the service desk and helped coordinate projects on base. I have also worked with IT companies to help foster relationships and order hardware needed
      the Communications Squadron. Furthermore, I have over two years of experience working with The Walt Disney company and have provided exceptional guest service 
      to customers from around the world.
